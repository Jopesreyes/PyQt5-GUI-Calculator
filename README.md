# Calculator
Welcome to desktop application exercise. PyQt5 is very useful for making GUI desktop application. I have made a PyQt5 based Calculator app. You can check out the scripts of the app and download or clone the files to further customize yourself.
1. I have used Qt Designer to design GUI Calculator initially which was an .ui script. I did not upload that because I had to convert the .ui file to an .py python script which is now MyCalculator.py; So, you can customize Widget, Fonts, Color, etc. from this script for user interface.
2. The next script Calculator.py is also a part of the whole app. The script was made for connecting buttons and make the calculator runs the binary operations. I could do it in the initial MyCalculator.py script but it is better to do the work dividing into steps.
3. Now, the final step is to run the app under Main.py script which includes the above scripts. Let me know if there is anything inconvenient. Good Luck.
